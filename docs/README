Perl Embedding Engine
---------------------

It is a template engine that allows embedded perl code in arbritrary
text (HTML is most likely the case) templates.

It is similar in concept to Sun's JSP and M$' ASP.

The project is hosted on sourceforge.net

Features
--------

* Simple design

The design of PEE is extremely simple.  The idea is that a template
will be pre-compiled (we call it the "page compilation" process) into 
valid perl code, which is then executed.


* Simple syntax

There are only 4 different types of special PEE tags that can go into
the (HTML) template, i.e. code blocks, expression blocks, pee directives,
and comment blocks.


* Flexible

Because the core of PEE is the page-compiler.  Special enhancements can
be made outside of the core module, like cached compilation or execution
daemon.
You also have several choices for using PEE, from the most conservative
(offline generation) to the more dynamic (Action directive), or invent your
own!


* Compatible

The output is simply Perl, how much more compatible can you get?


* Easy-to-install

Unlike many template languages, PEE does not require mod_perl,
which could be a pain.



VIM syntax highlighting
-----------------------
If you are a VIM user, you may edit PET files with syntax highlighting.
Install the 'misc/pet.vim'.  Read the VIM manual for instructions on
installing syntax files.



The documentation is organized as follows:

INSTALL          - installation instructions
INSTALL.FastCGI  - using PEE with FastCGI
README           - this file
SYNTAX           - directives
FAQ              - faked questions & answers (until I get real ones :)
TODO             - todo list
